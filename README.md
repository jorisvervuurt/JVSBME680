# JVSBME680
> An easy-to-use Node.js module for Pimoroni's BME680 Breakout

## Features
JVSBME680 allows you to make use of (almost) all features available in Pimoroni's [Python library](https://github.com/pimoroni/bme680).

## Hardware requirements

* [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
* Pimoroni [BME680 Breakout](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/bme680)

## Installation
Note: these installation instructions assume that your Raspberry Pi is running an installation of [Raspbian Stretch](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), with both [Node.js v8.x](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Additionally, JVSBME680 requires Python 2.x or later, which should come pre-installed with Raspbian.

Need help installing Node.js and npm? I've written an extensive tutorial, which you can find [here](https://github.com/jorisvervuurt/Tutorials/blob/master/Raspberry%20Pi/Installing%20and%20updating%20Node.js%20and%20npm.md).

### Preparing for the installation
1. First of all, make sure your Raspberry Pi is up-to-date:

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

2. Install Pimoroni's Python library using their super-easy installation script:

        curl https://get.pimoroni.com/bme680 | bash

3. Reboot the Raspberry Pi.

### Installing JVSBME680
1. Use `cd` to navigate to your Node.js project directory.

2. Install JVSBME680 using npm:

        npm install jvsbme680 --save

## Usage
1. Start by loading the module:

        const { BME680 } = require('jvsbme680');

2. Initialize the BME680 object:

        const bme680 = new BME680();

Note: if you'd like to use two BME680 Breakout boards simultaneously, you can simply pass the I2C address (as a `string`) to the constructor. See the [documentation of the Constants class](https://github.com/jorisvervuurt/JVSBME680/tree/master/documentation/Constants.md) for valid values. The `Constants` class is exported by the module, together with the `BME680` class.

The initialized BME680 object has a number of properties, allowing you to access each sensor of the BME680:

* `gasSensor` - an initialized `GasSensor` object for accessing the gas sensor
* `humiditySensor` - an initialized `HumiditySensor` object for accessing the humidity sensor
* `pressureSensor` - an initialized `PressureSensor` object for accessing the pressure sensor
* `temperatureSensor` - an initialized `TemperatureSensor` object for accessing the temperature sensor

Documentation for each of the above mentioned components can be found [here](https://github.com/jorisvervuurt/JVSBME680/tree/master/documentation).

Code examples that show how to use JVSBME680 can be found [here](https://github.com/jorisvervuurt/JVSBME680/tree/master/examples).
